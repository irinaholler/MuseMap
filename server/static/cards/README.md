# Cards Directory

This directory stores generated concert poster PNG files for each memory in the MuseMap application.

## Purpose

The `cards/` directory is used by the poster generation service to save and serve concert posters. Each memory can have a unique poster generated with:

- Artist name
- Venue and city information
- Concert date
- Color palette (generated from memory content)
- Track list (if available)
- QR code linking to the memory

## File Naming Convention

Poster files are named using the pattern: `card_{memory_id}.png`

Example:
- `card_1.png` - Poster for memory with ID 1
- `card_15.png` - Poster for memory with ID 15

## Generation Process

1. When a user clicks "Enrich" on a memory, the system generates a color palette
2. When a user clicks "Poster", the system creates a PNG poster using the `draw_poster()` function
3. The poster is saved to this directory with the naming convention above
4. The poster is served via the `/card/{id}.png` endpoint
